# Overview {.unnumbered}

In this mini course we will be exploring the use of computing and non-parametric method in statistical practice. This will look like a set of general programming and computing topics and methods. This will require that we use a statistical programming language in sophisticated ways, and the module will specifically explore techniques for advanced programming in R. 

Readings come from the [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) textbook by Hadley Wickham.
